Hi! I'm Agustín Sandoval — a Computer Engineering student from Chile passionate about clean code, thoughtful design, and the fusion of technology with personal expression.

Currently focused on mastering C programming, data structures, and web development fundamentals (HTML/CSS). I'm constantly improving my problem-solving skills and striving to build software that’s both functional and aesthetic.
Outside of code, you’ll find me at the gym, curating outfits, or watching anime that fuels my mindset. I believe tech should be as powerful and intentional as the life we live — that’s why I’m building my path with discipline, creativity, and a touch of flair.

"To achieve anything, you must be prepared to deviate from the norm."  
— Toji Fushiguro

Let’s connect and build cool things.
